# Knowledge Base

This directory contains stable, accumulated knowledge about the CloudForge project.

## Structure

```
knowledge/
├── architecture/    # System design, component diagrams, data flow
├── patterns/        # Code conventions, naming standards, error handling
├── tools/           # How to use specific tools and technologies
└── workflows/       # CI/CD, deployment, review processes
```

## Guidelines

- **Stable content only** — Don't put rapidly-changing info here
- **Reference from code** — Link to these docs from code comments
- **Keep current** — Update when patterns change
- **Examples help** — Include code examples where useful

## For Agents

When you're unsure how to approach something:
1. Check if there's a pattern documented here
2. If not, and you establish a new pattern, document it
3. Link to relevant knowledge in your ADRs
