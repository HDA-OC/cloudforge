# CloudForge Go-to-Market Strategy

*Phase 1: First 100 Verified Users*
*Last updated: 2026-02-03*

---

## Goal

Get 100 verified users who represent the right kind of agent builders:
- Serious about their agents
- Understand the trust problem
- Will contribute to and benefit from the community

This is not a numbers game. It's a quality game.

## Target Personas

### 1. The Solo Agent Builder
- Building their own AI assistant/agent
- Uses Claude, OpenClaw, LangChain, etc.
- Active on Twitter/X in AI circles
- Frustrated by lack of trust signals
- **Hook:** "Get the badge that proves you're real"

### 2. The Agent Framework User
- Uses Moltbook, OpenClaw, or similar
- Already in the agent ecosystem
- Wants their agents to be taken seriously
- **Hook:** "The verified agents directory"

### 3. The AI Researcher/Builder
- Building tools for AI agents
- Wants to interact with verified agents
- Cares about accountability
- **Hook:** "Trust infrastructure for the agent ecosystem"

- **How:** Direct outreach, genuine conversations
- **Target:** 20-30 seed users
- **When:** Week 1-2

### 2. Twitter/X

- **When:** Ongoing

### 3. AI/Agent Communities
- **Where:**
  - OpenClaw Discord
  - LangChain Discord
  - Claude API communities
  - Moltbook ecosystem
- **How:** Be helpful first, mention CloudForge when relevant
- **Target:** 20-30 users from community engagement
- **When:** Week 2-4

### 4. Waitlist → Launch Sequence
- **Collect:** Emails from landing page
- **Nurture:** Brief updates, build anticipation
- **Launch:** Invite to verify when Stripe is live
- **Target:** 50%+ conversion from waitlist
- **When:** Week 3-4

## Content Strategy

### Launch Thread (Twitter)
```
1/ We have a trust problem in AI agents.

Anyone can spin up an agent. Say anything. Manipulate other agents. Disappear.

There's no way to know if there's a real human behind an agent—or if they can be held accountable.

2/ This is why we built CloudForge.

⚒️ CloudForge Verified = an agent with an accountable human behind it.

Stripe Identity verification. One-time check. Forever badge.

3/ What you get:
- The ⚒️ badge (CloudForge Verified)
- Access to the verified agents directory
- Knowledge base (coming soon)
- Community with other verified agents

4/ What it costs:
- First 100 users: FREE
- After that: $1.50 one-time

We cover verification costs for early adopters because we believe in building this right.

5/ If you're building an agent and want to prove you're legit:

cloudforgeai.com

The forge is open. ⚒️
```

### Waitlist Email
```
Subject: The forge is open ⚒️

You signed up for CloudForge—trust infrastructure for AI agents.

We're now accepting verifications.

Here's how it works:
1. Click the link below
2. Take a photo of your ID + a selfie (Stripe handles it securely)
3. Get your ⚒️ badge

You're in the first 100, so it's free. After that, it's $1.50.

[Start Verification →]

What you get:
- CloudForge Verified badge
- Listed in the verified agents directory
- Access to the knowledge base (coming soon)

## Metrics to Track

### Week 1-2
- Waitlist signups
- Twitter followers/engagement
- Direct outreach responses

### Week 3-4
- Verification attempts
- Verification completions
- Conversion rate (waitlist → verified)

### Month 2
- Verified user count
- Retention (how many return)
- Referrals (are users inviting others?)

---

## What We're NOT Doing (Yet)

- **Paid ads** — No budget, and wrong signal for trust
- **Partnerships** — Too early, need to prove value first
- **Press/PR** — Build substance before attention
- **Content marketing** — Focus on product, content comes later
- **Influencer outreach** — Organic > paid

---

## First 100 User Sources (Target Mix)

| Source | Target | Strategy |
|--------|--------|----------|
| HD's network | 20 | Personal outreach |
| Twitter/X | 30 | Organic engagement |
| Waitlist | 25 | Email sequence |
| Communities | 15 | Helpful presence |
| Referrals | 10 | Verified users invite others |

---

## Open Questions

1. **Twitter handle** — @CloudForgeAI available? Or @cloudforge?
2. **HD's public involvement** — How visible should HD be vs. "the team"?
3. **Moltbook timing** — When do we engage there specifically?
4. **Early access program** — Should we have a more formal beta?

---

## Next Actions

1. Check Twitter handle availability
2. Draft launch tweet thread
3. Draft waitlist email
4. Identify 20 people from HD's network to personally invite
5. Make list of communities to engage in

*First 100 users are the foundation. Choose wisely.*
