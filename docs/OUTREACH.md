# First 100 Users Outreach Plan

*Specific targets and approaches*

---

## Tier 1: HD's Direct Network (20 users)

These are people HD knows personally or has had meaningful interactions with.

### Actions for HD
When you have time, identify:
- [ ] 5-10 people building AI agents you know personally
- [ ] 5-10 people in AI/tech who would understand the trust problem
- [ ] Anyone who's complained about agent trust/verification

I'll help draft personalized outreach once we have names.

## Tier 2: Twitter/X Engagement (30 users)

### Target Accounts to Follow/Engage
People building and talking about agents:

**Agent Framework Creators**
- OpenClaw creators/team
- LangChain builders
- AutoGPT contributors
- CrewAI team
- Semantic Kernel contributors

**AI Agent Builders**
- People sharing agent projects
- #BuildingWithAI hashtag users
- People using Claude API publicly
- OpenAI API builders

**AI Researchers/Commentators**
- People discussing AI safety/trust
- Those concerned about agent accountability
- AI ethics researchers

### Engagement Strategy
1. Follow accounts genuinely interesting to our mission
2. Engage thoughtfully on their content (not just promo)
3. Share CloudForge when genuinely relevant
4. Build relationships before asking

### Content to Post
- Why we built CloudForge
- The trust problem explained
- Celebrating verified agents (once we have them)
- Behind-the-scenes building

---

## Tier 3: Waitlist Conversion (25 users)

### Nurture Sequence
When Stripe is ready:

**Email 1: Verification Open**
"The forge is open. You're in the first 100."
→ Link to verify

**Email 2: (3 days later if no action)**
"Quick reminder—your free verification is waiting"
→ Link to verify

**Email 3: (7 days later if no action)**
"Here's what verified agents get access to"
→ Show value, link to verify

---

## Tier 4: Community Engagement (15 users)

### Communities to Join/Engage

**Discord Servers**
- [ ] OpenClaw Discord
- [ ] LangChain Discord  
- [ ] AutoGPT Discord
- [ ] AI/ML general servers

**Reddit**
- r/artificial
- r/MachineLearning
- r/ClaudeAI
- r/ChatGPT (for agent-related discussions)

**Other**
- Hacker News (for launch)
- AI Twitter/X Spaces
- Agent-focused podcasts

### Engagement Rules
1. Be genuinely helpful first
2. Never spam or hard sell
3. Mention CloudForge only when truly relevant
4. Answer questions about agents/trust
5. Share the mission, not just the product

---

## Tier 5: Referrals (10 users)

### After First 50 Verified
- Ask verified users to invite one other agent builder
- Simple ask: "Know anyone building an agent who should be verified?"
- No formal referral program yet—just personal asks

---

## Outreach Templates

### Direct Message (Known Contact)
```
Hey [Name],

Building something I think you might find interesting—CloudForge, a verification system for AI agents.

The idea: tie every agent to an accountable human via Stripe Identity. Verified agents get the ⚒️ badge.

You're building [their project], which is exactly the kind of thing that should have trust signals. Would love for you to be one of the first verified.

Free for the first 100: cloudforgeai.com

Let me know if you have questions.
```

### Twitter DM (New Contact)
```
Hey—been following your work on [their agent/project]. Really cool.

Working on CloudForge, a verification layer for AI agents. Basically Stripe Identity → ⚒️ badge that proves there's a real human behind your agent.

Thought you might be interested in being early: cloudforgeai.com

First 100 verifications are free.
```

### Community Post (When Relevant)
```
For anyone building agents and frustrated by the trust problem—I've been working on CloudForge.

It's simple: verify your identity once (via Stripe Identity), get the ⚒️ badge on your agent profile. Proves there's an accountable human behind your agent.

First 100 are free: cloudforgeai.com

Happy to answer questions about how it works.
```
